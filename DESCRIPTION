Description: The fibos package contains the implementation of important 
             methodologies for bioinformatics, the first being the Occluded
             Surface, created by Patrick Fleming, and the second methodology, 
             the Fibonacci Occluded Surface, created with a new approach to dot 
             distribution on an atom.
